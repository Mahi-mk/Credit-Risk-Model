Credit Scoring Business Understanding

How does the Basel II Accord’s emphasis on risk measurement influence our need for an interpretable and well-documented model? The Basel II Accord requires financial institutions to maintain a rigorous framework for risk measurement to ensure they have enough capital to cover potential losses. This emphasis means our model must be highly interpretable so that regulators and stakeholders can understand exactly how a credit score is calculated. A well-documented model ensures that the factors used to approve or deny a loan are transparent, helping the bank comply with international standards for capital adequacy and risk management.

Since we lack a direct "default" label, why is creating a proxy variable necessary, and what are the potential business risks of making predictions based on this proxy? Creating a proxy variable is necessary because we do not have historical data on who defaulted on loans in this new eCommerce partnership. By using behavior-based proxies like Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics, we can programmatically identify "disengaged" customers and label them as high-risk to train our predictive models. However, the business risks include misclassifying good customers as high-risk (leading to lost revenue) or inaccurately predicting default if the behavioral proxy does not perfectly align with a customer's actual financial reliability.

What are the key trade-offs between using a simple, interpretable model (like Logistic Regression with WoE) versus a complex, high-performance model (like Gradient Boosting) in a regulated financial context? In a regulated context, a simple model like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) is often preferred because it is highly transparent, making it easier to explain credit decisions to regulators and customers. While complex models like Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost) often provide higher predictive accuracy and better performance on non-linear data, they operate as "black boxes" that are much harder to interpret. The trade-off is choosing between the superior performance of a complex model and the lower regulatory risk and easier documentation provided by a simpler, more interpretable model.
